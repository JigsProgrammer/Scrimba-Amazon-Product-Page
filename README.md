# Scrimba Amazon Product Page
 This is a solo project, called Amazon Product Page, that I needed to do for a Scrimba lesson: Business Card Lesson.

In this project, I will be incorporating the following topics I learned from the lesson:
- Image alt texts
- Flex child containers
- Inheritance
- Shorthands
- Web-safe fonts
- Color palettes
- GitHub
